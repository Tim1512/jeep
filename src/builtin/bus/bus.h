     * First we need to get polynomial through the coefficients by extracting or
     * unloading bit stream of SOF, ARBID, CONTROL FIELD, DATA FIELD and for the
     * 15 lowest coefficents by 0. 
     *
     * Coefficents are are calculated using modulo-2. Once ready ...
     *
     * mod(data fld, 15)
     *
     * This polynomial is then devided by generator polynomial:
     *
     * X`15 + X`14 + X`10 + X`8 + X`7 + X`4 + X`3 + 1
     *
     * Once again, a beautiful crc sequence is in the reminder of above
     * polynomial. 
     *
     * Same function in BHC is possible through shift register `crc_rg` val 14,0. 
     *
     * --
     * CRC_RG = 0; # => Initialize shift register
     *
     * do { # => Do until got crc seq start
     *      CRCNXT       = NXTBIT XOR CRC_RG(14) # => eq: nxtbit âŠ• crc_rg
     *      CRC_RG(14:1) = CRC_RG(13:0); # => shift left by one bit
     *      CRC_RG(0)    = 0;
     *
     *      if CRCNXT then 
     *          CRC_RG(14:0) = CRC_RG(14:0) XOR (0x4599)

     * The above explains how CRC_RG at the end contains the CRC sequence.

     * Once everything is ready, prepare the operands for CRC splitter or
     * delimiter. Delimiter can be found at the LSB of the sequence. It consist
     * a single `RECESSIVE` bit.
