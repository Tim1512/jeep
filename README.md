> I continued working on jeep which is a some sort of WireShark sniffer but for vehicle/car systems (read: hacking tool for your car). It’s based on CAN, supposed to support fd (ext frame struct) from SocketCAN. The reason I’m writing this is because it’s fun and I need a can-utils which is extensible. Jeep should support extending through modules with built-in API. Project goal is to create system similar to Metasploit and stay opensource. This week I’m working on sniff module.
